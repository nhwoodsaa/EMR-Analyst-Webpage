				2005: "When a new clinic is created or an existing clinic changes the clinic code the EMR team needs to be informed. This is because the EMR team needs to configure the code within the EMR, if this is not done prior to booking a patient in iPM the patient will not show up on the Home screen within the EMR. This clinic has now been set up correctly within the EMR, however any patient who was booked prior to now will need to have their appointment re-triggered from iPM. To achieve this you need to edit the appointment within iPM and add a full stop to the comments field within the Dependent Resources tab. If you require further help with re-trigerring of iPM appointments please reach out to the Outpatients department.",
